ZebraTrace is a simple tool to trace bitmap images into a pattern of curves 
with a variable width. You can control amount of curves, resolution, min and 
max width, functions for plotting the curves.

The application was created primarily for Guilloché pattern design and all 
kinds of creative engraving.

ZebraTrace has a Qt4-based user interface and is written in Python.

How to run:

$ cd src
$ python ZebraTrace.pyw
